# ParaJax

Scaling differential equations via transferable dynamics.

## Features
- **Faster discovery** of dynamical systems.
- **Better learning** with advanced regularisation of the dynamics.
- **Transfer learning** with all its advantages (sim2real, etc...).
- Interpretable representations of high dimensional data via **latent variable models**.


## Getting started
`pip install parajax`
